# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


## Introduction

The program officially kicked on the 11th of February 2023 with a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG8blanhAOg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=12) where an overview of the proposed cruddur microblogging app was laid down.

Following the official kickoff, a number of homework task were given. Below is my checklist and execution of said tasks


## Required Homework


### 1. Week0 Spend Consideration

I watched and understood [Chirag's week0 spend considerations video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVw3RrlP-sI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=14) which gave insights into AWS billing console and how to setup budgets and alarms as a means to safeguard against overspending.


### 2. Week0 Security Consideration

I watched and understood [Ashish's week0 security considerations video](youtube.com/watch?v=OVw3RrlP-sI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=15)which highlighted security practises such as setting up IAM users and roles importance of enabling MFA, using cloudtrail and a number of other security practises.

This was quite important to know because, while AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, I am responsible for security **of** my infracstruce **in** the cloud


### 3. Recreate Conceptual Diagram on a Napkin

I created a conceptual diagram of the cruddur microblogging application on a [napkin saved on my Github](https://github.com/superklex/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week0/journal/myAssets/week0/myCruddurNapkinConceptualDiagram.jpeg)

### 4. Recreate Logical Architectural Diagram in Lucid Charts

Following [Andrew Browns Lucid Chart walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6FDrI_tz0k&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=17) I created a logical Architectural diagram of the cruddur microblogging application in [my Lucid Charts account](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8433e01a-0ee4-4ffb-be2f-ae881a524bc7/edit?invitationId=inv_da696cf9-dc84-4b71-8b7c-88afdb1979c5) which I uploaded to [my github](https://github.com/superklex/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week0/journal/myAssets/week0/myCruddurLucidLogicalDiagram.jpeg)
